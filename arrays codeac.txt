ARRAYS
Property Access
Each item in an array has a numbered position. We can access individual items using their numbers, just like we would in an ordinary list.

Something important to note is that JavaScript starts counting from 0 rather than 1, so the first item in an array will be at position 0. This is because JavaScript is zero-indexed.

We can select the first item in an array like this:

let newYearsResolutions = ['Rappel into a cave', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle'];

console.log(newYearsResolutions[0]);
// Output: 'Rappel into a cave'
You can also access individual characters in a string. For instance, you can write:

let hello = 'Hello World';
console.log(hello[6]);
// Output: W
W will be the output since it's the character in the 6th position. This works because JavaScript stores strings in a similar way that it stores arrays.

Update Elements
In the previous exercise, you learned how to access elements of an array or a string using their index number. You can also change elements of an array using their indices.

let seasons = ["Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Fall"];

seasons[3] = "Autumn";
console.log(seasons) 
//Output: 
//Winter 
//Spring
//Summer
//Autumn
In the example above, the seasons array contained the names of the four seasons.

However, we decided that we preferred to say "Autumn" instead of "Fall".

seasons[3] = "Autumn"; tells our program to change the item at index 3 of the seasons array to be "Autumn" instead of what is already there.
---------------------
let newYearsResolutions = ['Learn to code', 'Drink more water', 'Be more mindful'];

console.log(newYearsResolutions);
//output: [ 'Learn to code', 'Drink more water', 'Be more mindful' ]


//can store indiv array elements to var's!
let listItem = newYearsResolutions[0];
console.log(listItem);
//output: Learn to code


console.log(newYearsResolutions[1]);
//output: Drink more water


/*
console.log(newYearsResolutions[3]);
//output: undefined ([3] = empty
*/

newYearsResolutions[1] = 'Learn a new language';

console.log(newYearsResolutions);
// output: [ 'Learn to code', 'Learn a new language', 'Be more mindful' ]

***
ARRAYS: length property

We may wish to know how many items are stored inside of an array.

We can find this out by using one of an array's built-in properties, called length. We can attach this to any variable holding an array and it will return the number of items inside.

let newYearsResolutions = ['Rappel into a cave', 'Take a falconry class'];

console.log(newYearsResolutions.length);
// Output: 2
In the example above, we log newYearsResolutions.length to the console. This code retrieves the length property of the newYearsResolutions array and logs it to the console. This array has two items, so 2 would be logged to the console.

ARRAYS
push Method
JavaScript has built in methods for arrays that help us do common tasks. Let's learn some of them.

First, .push() allows us to add items to the end of an array. Here is an example of how this is used:

let newYearsResolutions = ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2'];

newYearsResolutions.push('item 3', 'item 4');
The method .push() would make the newYearsResolutions array look like:

['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2', 'item 3', 'item 4'];
How does .push() work?

It connects to newYearsResolutions with a period.

Then we call it like a function. That's because .push() is a function and one that JavaScript allows us to use right on an array.

Another array method, .pop(), is similar to .push(). This method removes the last item of an array.

let newYearsResolutions = ['item 0', 'item 1', 'item 2'];

newYearsResolutions.pop();

console.log(newYearsResolutions); 
// Output: [ 'item 0', 'item 1' ]
In the example above, calling .pop() on the newYearsResolutions array removed item 2 from the end.

More Array Methods
There are many more array methods than just .push() and .pop(). You can read about all of the array methods that exist on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation.

.pop() and .push() modify the array on which they're called. However, there are some array methods that don't modify the array. Be sure to check MDN to understand the behavior of the method you are using.

Some methods that JavaScript developers use frequently are .join(), .slice(), .splice(), .shift(), .unshift(), and .concat() amongst many others.

Below, we will explore some methods that we have not learned yet. We will use these methods to edit a grocery list. As you complete the steps, you can consult the MDN documentation to learn what each method does!
----------------
let groceryList = ['orange juice', 'bananas', 'coffee beans', 'brown rice', 'pasta', 'coconut oil', 'plantains'];

groceryList.shift();

groceryList.unshift('popcorn');
console.log(groceryList);
/*output: [ 'popcorn',
  'bananas',
  'coffee beans',
  'brown rice',
  'pasta',
  'coconut oil',
  'plantains' ]*/
console.log(groceryList.slice(1, 4));
//output: [ 'bananas', 'coffee beans', 'brown rice' ]

/*if console.log(groceryList.slice(-2, -1));
output: ["coconut oil"]*/

ARRAYS
Arrays with let and const
You may recall that you can declare variables with both the let and const keywords. Variables declared with let can be reassigned.

Variables that are assigned with const cannot be reassigned. However, arrays that are declared with const remain mutable, or changeable.

This means that we can change the contents of an array, but cannot reassign the variable name to a new array or other data type.

The instructions below will illustrate this more clearly. Pay close attention to the similiarities and differences between the condiments array and the utensils array as you complete the steps.

---------------
let condiments = ['Ketchup', 'Mustard', 'Soy Sauce', 'Sriracha'];

const utensils = ['Fork', 'Knife', 'Chopsticks', 'Spork'];

condiments.push('Hummus');
console.log(condiments);
/*output: [ 'Ketchup',
  'Mustard',
  'Soy Sauce',
  'Sriracha',
  'Hummus' ]*/
condiments = ['paleo-friendly'];
console.log(condiments);
//output: [ 'paleo-friendly' ]

utensils.pop();
console.log(utensils);
/*output: [ 'Fork', 'Knife', 'Chopsticks' ]*/

utensils = ['hands'];
console.log(utensils);
//output: TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

/*as ABOVE- cant reassign values to const variable;
but CAN change contents of the const arrays (eg pop, shift, slice, split, unshift etc are OK) */
